## This document shows a step-by-step procedure of how the variables were selected for modeling

## Loading the packages

```{r, packages}
library(tidyverse)
library(lasso2)
```

## Loading the datasets

```{r, load}
s17_1 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/season2017.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")
s17_2 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/FPL_2016_17_new.csv")
s18_1 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/season2018.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")
s18_2 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/FPL_2017_18_new.csv")
s19_1 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/season2019.csv", encoding = "UTF-8")
s19_2 <- read.csv("~/DSI-SRP1/FPL_2018_19_new.csv")
```

## Variable selector

```{r}
var_sel <- function(df) {
  df %>% 
    select(goals_scored,assists,total_points,minutes.played,bonus,
           bps,goals_conceded,clean_sheets,ict_index,position_index,
           selected_by_percent)
}
```


### This is done using the seasonal datasets that is going to be used for modeling

```{r, variable selection}
s17_1n <- var_sel(s17_1)
s18_1n <- var_sel(s18_1)
s19_1n <- var_sel(s19_1)
s_combined <- rbind(s17_1n, s18_1n, s19_1n)
lasso.s <- l1ce(total_points ~., data = s_combined)
summary(lasso.s)$coefficients
lasso.s <- l1ce(total_points ~ ict_index + bps + clean_sheets + bonus,
                data = s_combined)
summary(lasso.s)$coefficients
```
